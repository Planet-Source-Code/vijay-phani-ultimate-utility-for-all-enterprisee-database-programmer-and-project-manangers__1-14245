## Ultimate Utility for all Enterprisee database programmer and Project manangers


</div>

### Description

PlanetSource code is a life for VB programmers. I have learned many thing from this website so I felt I will give this code to all the programmers who are willing to learn the database concepts.

I tried for this kind of code but all in vain.

Dont worry. This is the best and the ultimate code for all the Database programmers who have been waiting for ages.

The whole world is looking for a control of this sort. I as a enterprise solution provider found it very difficult to debug the recordset and find the exact match in the recordset by pressing F8 .. F8 .. F8. Dont you think doing this way wastes your time and money...

The main purpose of this code is to print the contents of the recordset of ADO,DAO,RDO. Within a fly we can see the contents of the recordset. This will save a lot of time. The main purpose of this code is to pin point the exact location of the data that we need.

We use filters to check the data and reduce the recordset to find the exact match. But this control by clicking on the tab sort the contents of the recordset and display to us. You can change the order of the recordset fields by dragging.
 
### More Info
 
Open any damn recordset and pass to view the contents.

Add the printrecordset project.

In the next project. add references PrintRecordset

and declare a variable

dim prs as new PrintTable.clsRecordset

prs.printTable l_rsCustomers

l_rsCustomers here is the recordset

Thats it watch it displaying the contents of the recordset.

Nothing a simple database programmer who is looking forward to be great Advanced programmer

No Side effects
